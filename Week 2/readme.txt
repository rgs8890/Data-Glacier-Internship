# Data Glacier Internship Python Notebook

This project consists of the Python Notebook of the Data Glacier Internship. There are 4 datasets involved within this task, and they are:


- Cab Data - consisting of all the cab companies (Transaction ID, Date of Travel, Company, City, KM Travelled, Price Charged, Cost of Trip)
- City Data - consisting of all cities (City, Population, Users)

- Customer Data - consisting of all Customer ID, Gender, Age, Income(USD/ Month)
- Transaction ID - consisting of Payment Mode, Customer ID, Transaction ID

We merge these together into a master_dataframe, then proceed with EDA on the following:


- Users per Company
- Profit per Company

- Yearly Analysis
- Analysing Customer ID Change Yearly

- Analysing Number of Rides Change Yearly
- Analysing Profit Change Yearly

- Profit Change (%) by Year and Company
- Analysing Customer Retention

- Analysing Customer Retention of Yello Cab Customers
- Analysing Customer Retention of Pink Cab Customers

- Analysing Cost Change Yearly
- Analysing Price Change Yearly

- Area-wise Profit by Company
- Pink Cab + Yellow Cab Profit Distribution

- Percentage Population by City
- Customer Gender x Company x Profit

- Number of Rides by Gender
- Number of Customers by Gender

- Company Profit by Age Category
- Company Rides by Age Category

- Number of Customers by Age Category
- Company Profit by Age Category

- Prices Charged + Cost of Trip per Both Companies
- Distributions of Gender, Ride Count and Income for Customers

- Average of Profit by City per Company
- Average Ride Count per Customer by City

- Average Age of Users by Gender and Company
- How profits change with respect to income?

- How prices change with respect to distance?
- How price per KM has changed with respect to time?

- Profit Changes on Average per Day

Hypothesis Testing

- Hypothesis 1: Is there any difference in the KM travelled and price per KM?
- Hypothesis 2: Is there any difference between income (USD/ Month) and the distance for each journey?

- Hypothesis 3: Is there any difference between income (USD/ Month) and the number of rides?
- Hypothesis 4: Is there a difference between payment mode and the income (USD/ Month)?

- Hypothesis 5: Is there any difference in the Profit regarding the Age?
- Hypothesis 6: Is there any difference in Profit regarding Gender?
